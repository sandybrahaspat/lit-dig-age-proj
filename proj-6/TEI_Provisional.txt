               <line>enclosing each line separately in an opening</line>
               <line>and closing "line" tag, like what you see</line>
               <line>here. Try to capture additions (insertions)</line>
               <line>and deletions (cancellations). An example would be something like this: The mass of</line>

               <line>with other terms of your own as appropriate.</line>
               <line>Just be consistent. Use the handShift</line>
               <line>element for insertions that are in pencil.</line>
               <line>If they're in the same ink used for the</line>
               <line>main text, you can omit this step. You're</line>
               <line>sure to find this work very <unclear reason="illegible"></unclear></line>
               <!-- Another thing you should know. Sometimes Thoreau draws a vertical line through an entire passage or even through a whole page. This kind of mark isn't a deletion. He does this to indicate to himself that he's carried the passage over to a subsequent draft or another part of the current draft. If you come across and example and want to encode it, the right way to do it is: <metamark function="used" rend="line" /> -->
